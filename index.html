    <h2 style="text-align: center;">"Who are you?"</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I am an undergraduate student in the computer science stream who is also an astrophysics geek. 
        Space excites me. While I am constantly researching to find a common intersection between my passion and education, I love 
        spreading knowledge about the cosmos and my core academic subjects (whenever I get a chance to).
        <br>
        If you're a fan of Harry Potter or Rick Riordan's Greek universe, you're my best buddy.
